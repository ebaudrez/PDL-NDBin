 - never released on CPAN

 [API change: preferred interface]
 - the object-oriented interface is now the preferred interface (Edward Baudrez)
 - require the axis specifications in new() to be given as key => value pairs
   (Edward Baudrez)
 - make_labels() has been removed; you should use the method labels() now; call
   as follows:
      my $binner = PDL::NDBin->new( axes => [ [ 'x', ... ] ] );
      $binner->feed( x => $x );
      my @labels = $binner->labels;
   The required data can also be fed directly to labels() if desired:
      my @labels = $binner->labels( x => $x );
   (Edward Baudrez)
 - process_axes() has been removed; you should use autoscale() now (see below)
   (Edward Baudrez)
 - support for DEFAULT_ACTION has been dropped; it is now required to specify
   an action for every variable (Edward Baudrez)
 - variables no longer assume a default action when none is supplied; it is now
   required to state the action explicitly for every variable. To continue to
   use the default action of producing a histogram, use the following:
      ndbin( ..., vars => [ $x, 'Count' ] );
   (Edward Baudrez)

 [New features]
 - in addition to 'step', 'min', and 'n', new() now also accepts 'max' and
   'round' in axis specifications (Edward Baudrez)
 - added a method feed() to feed data piecewise (or all at once) before calling
   process(); this can be very useful when data is being read from a file. It
   essentially separates the data feeding from the processing step (both were
   done at the same time before, in the call to process()). This also means you
   can now call process() without arguments, provided that you have already fed
   all required data before. (Edward Baudrez)
 - added a method autoscale() to have missing axis specifications derived
   automatically from the data. As a side effect, it is now allowed to call the
   constructor with too few or even without any axis specifications:
      my $binner = PDL::NDBin->new( axes => [ [ x => ( n => 10 ) ],
                                              [ 'y' ] ] );
      $binner->process( x => $x, y => $y );
   This used to raise an error in previous versions. (Edward Baudrez)

 [Other improvements]
 - also greatly expanded the manual, test suite, and benchmark (Edward Baudrez)
 - fixed a few bugs (Edward Baudrez)

0.003 2012-08-10

 - never released on CPAN
 - PDL::NDBin now supports concatenation of calls: very useful to process
   multiple input files. You need use the object-oriented interface to do this.
   (Edward Baudrez)
 - API change for action coderefs: the first (and only) argument is now an
   iterator instead of a piddle containing the selected data. This means that
   where coderefs looked like this in the previous version:
      sub { my $pdl = shift; return $pdl->avg }
   you now have to write:
      sub { my $iter = shift; return $iter->selection->avg }
   (Edward Baudrez)
 - exceptions in actions are no longer caught. This change requires the user to
   protect from potentially dangerous code with an 'eval' block. (Edward
   Baudrez)
 - in addition to coderefs, now also accepts action class names (Edward
   Baudrez)
 - continued the object-oriented refactoring (Edward Baudrez)
 - greatly expanded the test suite (Edward Baudrez)

0.002 2012-07-11

 - never released on CPAN
 - now using Log::Any for logging (Edward Baudrez)
 - started refactoring by moving to object-oriented core implementation, with
   wrapper functions. This change is not yet visible at the user level, but
   will become so in the next version. (Edward Baudrez)

0.001 2012-06-28

 - never released on CPAN
 - imported the code in a Git repository (Edward Baudrez)
